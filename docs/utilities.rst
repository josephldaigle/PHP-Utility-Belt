All namespaces begin with :code:`PhpUtilityBelt\\` by default.

Each 'component' is found within a top-level namespace, and should
indicate to some degree what task it will help you accomplish.

Ideally, you will find packages that help you reduce the amount of code
you need to write, and focus on designing your application.
